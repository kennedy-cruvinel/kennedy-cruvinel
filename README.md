## About me:

I'm a 20-year-old developer and I've been studying since I was 18. I love discovering, studying new languages and delving into them. I have a certain knowledge in several areas such as data science, UX/UI but what I delve deeper into is being a full stack programmer


I'm a Fullstack Developer :smile:
